# ToeTacTic - The only tictactoe game you will ever need!

With this app, you can play tictactoe with friends online. You can create and join games with a game id, using a set of API from our lecturer. Your friends can download others app and play with you as long as you both use the same API. 

Under is pictures on how the app looks.

The app starts off with a sleek design on a loading screen, which then sends you to the main screen.

In the main screen you have the option to create a new game or join a friends game. You need to pick a name before both creating a game or joining one, unless you want to be stuck as Player 1 or 2 forever.

This is how it looks like when the loading screen is done, with a nice design and a logo.

Creating a game makes you player 1, you have to wait for a player 2 for the name of your friend to update. This is what it looks like when you're waiting in your lobby. You can easily read the gameid and give it to people. The board is waiting to be used.

This is what it looks like playing against someone, if you join a player, you're player 2, and go second. When someone wins, an animated text shows up on screen, announcing the winner. The Toast in the bottom is from onResume() so the app opens up where it was if you click the home button.

Further work on this app would be to implement some form of database or cloud saving. The ability to save users would open many possibilites further, like keeping a highscore, win percentage and much more.
